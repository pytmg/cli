# V0 - A Version... what even is this?
  There's absolutely nothing going on here, it's just a.. filler version and really hard to use.
  Is the baseline version, so there's that, I guess.

# V1 - The Object-Oriented Edition
  Now it's Object-Oriented and a framework, so this is the initial version for a really basic CLI system.

# V2 - The Looks Edition
  - Looks way better! Using "curses" and has more general improvements.

> This is the latest version - V2
