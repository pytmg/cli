Made for folks who want to create a CLI script but canâ€™t be bothered with the hassle.

Itâ€™s **super easy to use**:
1. Download the `cli` repository.
2. Add this to your script:
   ```python
   from cli import CLI
   ```
3. Check out the Docs - [Documentation.md](./Documentation.md)
4. Have fun building! ðŸŽ‰
