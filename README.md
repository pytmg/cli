Made for folks who want to create a CLI script but canâ€™t be bothered with the hassle.

Itâ€™s **super easy to use**:
1. Download the `cli` folder.
2. Add this to your script:
   ```python
   from cli import CLI
   ```
3. Check out the Docs - [Documentation.md](./Documentation.md)
4. Have fun building! ðŸŽ‰

## About CLI V2-beta

> **Usage**:
> ```python
> from cli.beta import CLI
> ```
> Check out the `example.py` file for changes and usage examples.

CLI V2-beta is still in development. While itâ€™s **way better** than before, full documentation isnâ€™t ready yet.
The two big tasks left:
1. **Submenu support** â€“ Now working like the old version!
2. **Colored options** â€“ Still in progress. | May scrap though.

> [!WARNING]
> **Beta means bugs!**
> - **Known Crashes**:
>   - Resizing the terminal *too small* causes a crash (thanks, `curses`).
> - **Issues**:
>   - Sometimes the menu mysteriously disappears (*being worked on*).
