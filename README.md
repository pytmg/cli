![Total Commits](https://badgen.net/github/commits/pytmg/cli?color=black&icon=github)

Created for those who want to make a CLI script, but cannot be asked with it.

Really easy to use, you just download the `cli` folder, use `from cli import CLI` and have fun with it!

## About CLI V2-beta

> Usage:
> ```python
> from cli.beta import CLI
> ```
> Changes are shown in `example.py`.

It's still in beta, there's no documentation until it's fully done, and the only two things I have left to make are submenu support and coloured options, but is a LOT better than before.

> [!WARNING]
> Since the new version **is in beta**, expect crashes every now and then
> - Known crashes
>   - When making the terminal really small, it crashes
> - Issues
>   - When trying to make submenus the old way, it works, until you exit the submenu, cuz now nothing responds
>     - BEING WORKED ON
>   - Sometimes things disappear
>     - BEING WORKED ON
