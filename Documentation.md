## No.

Just.. no.

V0 is unfathomably difficult to use. Do not use it.

If you do decide, for some reason, to work with it, then, good job? I guess?

## DO NOT USE V0.

It sucks. I have, however tried to add comments where applicable, but really, its just extra work. Seriously, I hated using V0, hence the existance for V1.

:)

## Alternatives to V0

If you want the same *looks* and feel as V0, use V1, otherwise, use V3 because not only is it faster, but way easier to create larger menus than whatever the terminal size is.

Have fun.

*you may want to `git checkout main` :)*
